A folder to store all the instructions and descriptions about the House Prices Prediction Kaggle competition, Jupyter Notebooks created to analyze the case studay and CSV/pkl files 
generated in each of the notebooks.

Details of the structure of the folders:

* BASELINE MODELS FILES Folder >>> Test and Train data ready to be trained and tested by the Logistics Regression, the Random Forest Regressor and the ANN models.
* CLEANED DATA Folder >>> Train and test data cleaned after removing null values and other columns irrelevant for the analysis.
* ORIGINAL DATA Folder >>> The train and tes data exported from the Kaggle portal.
* PICTURES Folder >>> All the pictures used in the Jupyter Notebooks.
* PREDICTED VALUES Folder >>> SalePrice values predicted by the Logistics Regression, the Random Forest Regressor and the Artificial Neural Network.

Below you can find the main Jupyter Notebooks created to build a predictive regression model that could be able to learn through the input variables:
* House Prices Prediction - Kaggle Competition.ipynb
* ANN & House Prices Prediction.ipynb

We have created other Notebooks created to test some functionalities, which are linked to the notebooks detailed before:
* Categorical Data - Analysis & Testing.ipynb
* Categorical Data - Dummy Variables Testing.ipynb
* Testing Variables Distribution Applying 'Logarithms'.ipynb
