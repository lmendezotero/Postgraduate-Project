## Description of the project üîä

The goal of the project is to find the best fitting model for predicting the house prices of the Ames city, a region of the United States, by applying advanced regressions techniques. This case study is part of a kaggle competition, which is called [House Prices Prediction: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

We have created a working team (bcnDataScience) in the Leaderboard of the Kaggle competition to participate in it and get the best possible result. To do this, we have analyzed the data and created some regressions models based on Logistics Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Artificial Neural Networks.
