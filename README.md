## Description of the project üîä

The goal of the project is to find the best fitting model for predicting the house prices of the Ames city, a region of the United States, by applying advanced regressions techniques. This case study is part of a kaggle competition, which is called [House Prices Prediction: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

We have created a working team (bcnDataScience) in the Leaderboard of the Kaggle competition to participate in it and get the best possible result. To do this, we have analyzed the data and created some regressions models based on Logistics Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Artificial Neural Networks.

## Folders Structure & Content üìã
The material contained in this repository is divided into 2 main folders:

### House Prices Prediction üìÇ
Here we store the material with which we have been working most of the life of the project. On one hand, documents with explanations of the challenge and data downloaded from the kaggle platform are available.

On another hand, we have created several Jupyter Notebooks to carry out detailed analysis and visualizations of the data and test functionalities and performance of the models generated in python. Finally, we have saved the csv and pkl files generated with the different notebooks in various subfolders to classify the information and avoid confusion.
